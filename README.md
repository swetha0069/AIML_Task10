Task 10: KNN - Handwritten Digit ClassificationProject OverviewThis project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model to classify handwritten digits (0-9). Using the load_digits dataset from Scikit-learn, the model identifies patterns in 8x8 pixel images to predict the correct numerical label.WorkflowData Loading: Loaded the Sklearn Digits dataset and verified its structure.Visualization: Displayed sample images to understand pixel-to-label mapping.Preprocessing: Applied StandardScaler to normalize data, which is essential for distance-based algorithms like KNN.Hyperparameter Tuning: Evaluated the model using multiple K values ($3, 5, 7, 9$).Evaluation: Generated an Accuracy vs. K plot and a Confusion Matrix to analyze misclassifications.Key Technical FindingsBest K Value: $K=3$ provided the optimal balance of accuracy and generalization.Distance Metric: Used Euclidean distance to measure similarity between pixel vectors.Scaling Impact: Without scaling, the model performance drops as pixel intensity variances skew the distance calculations.Tools UsedLanguage: PythonLibraries: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy
